## My process

I started this project a while ago, but didn't have any experience with grid, which is how I was trying to style it. I stopped and then recently came back to it after watching a YouTube video by Kevin Powell on how to approach this challenge. I had already made my HTML layout, so I was adapting what I had already created with pointers from the video, so the CSS isn't as clean as it could be. My HTML was also a little messy and over engineered.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about Grid from completing this challenge. Up until now I only used flexbox for controlling layout and responsive design because I haven't really learned a lot about how to set it up. I'm looking forward to using more grid in the future. 

### Continued development

I'm going to continue to try using Grid in different projects to practice. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) - This helped me when using the Document Object Model to create this project. 
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp) - This Udemy course has helped to learn how to use the DOM. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [YouTube: Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/rg7Fvvl3taU?si=t8x5nKKq4dzt7tot) - After I got stuck trying to learn Grid on my own, I watched this video by Kevin Powell to help with my mistakes.
